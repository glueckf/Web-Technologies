# Web Technologies

A comprehensive project collection focusing on web development fundamentals, client-side programming, and modern web technologies.

## Project Goals

This project was developed as part of the "Webtechnologien" module at TU Berlin to teach fundamental web technologies and their practical applications in modern web development. Key focus areas:

* Understanding and implementing HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* DOM manipulation and dynamic web content
* Client-server communication using REST APIs
* Asynchronous programming with AJAX and Fetch
* Implementation of responsive web applications using Bootstrap

## Technologies

* Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Vue.js
* UI Framework: Bootstrap 5
* Development Environment: Webstorm IDE

## Project Structure

The project consists of multiple homework assignments, each focusing on different aspects of web development:

* ha01: Basic HTML
* ha02: Basic CSS and JavaScript
* ha03: Advanced CSS and JavaScript
* ha04: Building a complete single page application with Bootstrap and APIs
* kanban: A full-stack Kanban board application

## Kanban Project

The Kanban project is a comprehensive full-stack web application developed across three iterations:

* ha05: Setting up the Vue.js application structure and implementing Bootstrap styling
* ha06: Implementing the core application logic for card management (create, edit, delete)
* ha07: Building a complete full-stack solution by integrating a Node.js backend

The Kanban project follows professional development practices using Git branching strategy, where each homework iteration is developed in its own branch while maintaining the complete development history.

## Status

Currently in active development. Latest completed assignment is ha05. The project showcases an evolution from basic web fundamentals to modern full-stack development practices.
